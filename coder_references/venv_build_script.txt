==> during development - to add modules to the environment <==
     ===> macOS - run from terminal
cd /Users/family/Projects/Git/robot_battle   # move to correct directory
source venv/bin/activate    # start up the virtual environment - macOS
python3 -m pip install requests  # this adds the module requests to the virtual environment

deactivate   # after application exits, kill the virtual environment


     ===> windows - run from command line
cd /Users/family/Projects/Git/robot_battle   # ????
.\env\Scripts\activate    # start up the virtual environment - macOS
py -m pip install requests  # this adds the module requests to the virtual environment

deactivate   # after application exits, kill the virtual environment





=========================================================================
==> run the application on the SAME machine with existing venv folder <==
     ===> macOS - run from terminal
cd /Users/family/Projects/Git/robot_battle   # move to correct directory
source venv/bin/activate    # start up the virtual environment
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./controllerLib"   # tell it to look here for my home-made functions
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./apiLib"  # tell it to look here for my home-made functions
python robot_rest_api.py   # fire up the application!!
==> application is running now - have fun
[CTRL-C]
deactivate   # after application exits, kill the virtual environment


     ===> windows - run from command line
cd ...\robot_battle   # CHANGE THIS TO CORRECT FOLDER
.\env\Scripts\activate    # start up the virtual environment
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:.\controllerLib"   # tell it to look here for my home-made functions
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:.\apiLib"  # tell it to look here for my home-made functions
python robot_rest_api.py   # fire up the application!!
==> application is running now - have fun
[CTRL-C]
deactivate   # after application exits, kill the virtual environment



====================================================================
==> run the application on DIFFERENT machine without venv folder <==
     ===> macOS - run from terminal
cd /Users/family/Projects/Git/robot_battle   # move to correct directory
source venv/bin/activate    # start up the virtual environment
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # from requirements.txt load the correct environment modules to be able to run
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:./controllerLib"   # tell it to look here for my home-made functions
